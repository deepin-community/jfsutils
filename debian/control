Description: stripped-down version of jfsutils, for debian-installer
 This package is a jfsutils package built for reduced size, so that it
 can help to save space in debian-installer.

 Don't attempt to install this package, it has no support for a couple of
 features you surely want.  Anyway, it should fail to install.
